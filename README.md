# PREDICTION-OF-INDICATIONS-OF-CERVICAL-CANCER-USING-HINSELMANN-TEST

Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of cervical cancer can significantly improve the chances

of successful treatment and save lives. This dataset help to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to identify individuals at high risk of cervical cancer, allowing

for timely intervention and medical care.

Cervical cancer is the term used to describe tumours that can grow at the lower end of the womb. These tumours usually develop from abnormal cell changes at the entrance to the womb from 

the vagina (the opening of the cervix). Abnormal cell changes can be detected through screening and then removed. A vaccine against viruses that cause cancer (HPV vaccine) can reduce the 

risk of cervical cancer.

**Problem Statement**

Cervical cancer is the leading gynecological malignancy worldwide.

The business objective is to build a Machine Learning Prediction Model that predicts the result of Hinselmann test and thereby confirming the presence/non-presence of cervical cancer in the 

patients.

It is studied that there is more chance of survival if the cancer is detected during its early stages.

STDs:condylomatosis – It indicates the presence of Condylomatosis with the patient.

STDs:cervical condylomatosis –It indicates the presence of Cervical condylomatosis.

STDs:vaginal condylomatosis - It indicates the presence of Vaginal condylomatosis.

STDs:vulvo-perineal condylomatosis – It indicates the presence of Vulvo- Perineal condylomatosis.

Hinselmann (TARGET) – also known as colposcopy, is a medical diagnostic procedure to examine an illuminated, magnified view of the cervix as well as the vagina and vulva.

Schiller - Schiller Iodine test is a medical test in which iodine solution is applied to the cervix in order to diagnose cervical cancer.

Cytology – also called as PaP smears test, helps detect abnormal cells in the cervix, which can develop into cancer.

Biopsy - A cervical biopsy is a surgical procedure in which a small amount of tissue is removed from the cervix. A cervical biopsy is usually done after an abnormality has been found during cytology.
